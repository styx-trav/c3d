still no threads ????

looking at the map ::

strong af parsing ::
	check all elements are given
	no order to elements, parsing through identifers (NE, F, etc.)
	checking texture paths are valid
	valid color structure :: 0 to 255, separated by commas, 3 values
	map ::
		no forbidden characters
		no mult players, but at least one
		border wall (first line, last line, first char, last char, + space-adjacent chars)

translation file map to char **map ::
	get longest line (including spaces at the beginning), allocate that to lines
	re-read and transcribe

translation char **map to struct *map ::
	start at the player, store that, then build on recursive calls based on nwse dirs
	if space, hit NULL, return, etc.

simplistic structures first ::

north, west, east, south : following piece of the map, NULL if no;
type : wall, empty; 1,0;
colors : floor, ceiling;
access to the textures
