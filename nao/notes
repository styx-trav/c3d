still no threads ???? ??!

////////////////////////start for current events//////////////////////////////
started on the parsing
	tested
		double elements, check
		bad names, check
		not enough elements, check
		cutoff, check
		bad file, somewhat check
		empty lines, check
		bad color input, check
		info after element && before newline, check
	will however want to do an overhaul of the first part (textures), now that we have gnl implemented
		--later, if we really want to. for now, works fine.
	also, its all over the place. we'll fix that

started on the conversion
	overhauled, works fine but needs merging
	might want to switch to an (i, j) type overlay later for easier layout and merge, if necessary
		
unsure what type of files textures will be, but I assume an open on RDONLY will be enough to check them ? will add

next up ::
	fix texture parsing with gnl -- later or not at all.
	re-organize code for cleaner read, + explanation comments (norme ?)

////////////////////////end of current events/////////////////////////////////

looking at the map ::

strong af parsing ::
	check all elements are given
	no order to elements, parsing through identifers (NE, F, etc.)
	checking texture paths are valid
	valid color structure :: 0 to 255, separated by commas, 3 values
	map ::
		no forbidden characters
		no mult players, but at least one
		border wall (first line, last line, first char, last char, + space-adjacent chars)

translation file map to char **map ::
	get longest line (including spaces at the beginning), allocate that to lines
	re-read and transcribe

translation char **map to struct *map ::
	start at the player, store that, then build on recursive calls based on nwse dirs
	if space, hit NULL, return, etc.

simplistic structures first ::

north, west, east, south : following piece of the map, NULL if no;
type : wall, empty; 1, 0;
colors : floor, ceiling;
access to the textures (images ? filename for now)
