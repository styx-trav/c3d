still needed :: perspective texture display

raycasting !! the dda method, suited to current needs ::

float deltaX : abs(1/cos_angle); --> the distance to next square horizontally
float deltaY : abs(1/sin_angle); --> the distance to next square vertically
	>>correct, works great so far (mini quadrillage)

moving in both directions using regular int x, y for the map check since we move by one square of the map;
first to hit returns infos :: x or y hit, distance calculated by distx.y - delta (mult by 64 for our 64x64 square map);

first step :: checking deltas are correct estimates of when the map changes
	looking good
seconds step :: the insquare calculations, done (initial distx.y)
third step :: while loop and display
		and after hours and hours of looking for dumbass mistakes, here it is !!
